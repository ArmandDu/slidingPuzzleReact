# React - Sliding Puzzle

A small sliding puzzle game written wih React.

### Motivation

After trying out [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/),
 I wanted to try implement and use ReasonReact's ["reducerComponent"](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/state-actions-reducer.html) pattern.


Try out the [ReasonReact version](https://puzzle.apptize.fr)
or [React version](https://puzzle.apptize.fr/?v=react).

The [ReasonReact Repo](https://github.com/ArmandDu/slidingPuzzleReasonReact)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
